# Dynamic Functions Practice #1
# Create a function (all_positives) that returns True if all the values in a list are positive, and False if at least one of the values is negative. Create a list named numbers with positive and negative values.

# Don't call the function, you just need to define it.



# list_numbers = [10, 25, -3, 42, 7]

# def all_positives(list_numbers):
#     for num in list_numbers:
#         if num < 0:
#             return False
#         return True
#     print (all_positives{list_numbers})



# Dynamic Functions Practice #2
# Create a function (sum_less) that adds the numbers of a list as long as they are greater than 0 and less than 1000, and returns the result of said sum. Create a numbers variable, storing a list of numbers so we can test it.
numbers = [10, 250, 3000, -5, 700, 999] 
def sum_less(numbers): 
    total = 0 for num in numbers:
     if 0 < num < 1000: total += num 
     return total



# Dynamic Functions Practice #3
# Create a function (count_even) that counts the number of even numbers that exist in a list (numbers), and returns the result of said count.
def count_even(numbers):  
    count = 0  ]
    for num in numbers:  
        if num % 2 == 0: 
        count += 1  
        return count
